Python #1 - Part of academic Project - 
            #Contains python program to retrieve scores based on the school provided as argument from Url.
               1. takes one argument, like "Old Dominion" or "Virginia Tech"
               2. takes another argument specified in seconds (e.g., "60" for 
                  one minute).
               3. takes a URI as a third argument, such as:
                 http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/scoreboard?confId=80&seasonYear=2013&seasonType=2&weekNumber=2
                 or
                 http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/scoreboard?confId=80&seasonYear=2013&seasonType=2&weekNumber=1
                 or
                 http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/scoreboard?confId=80&seasonYear=2012&seasonType=2&weekNumber=1
                 etc.
               4. downloads the URI, finds the game corresponding to the team
               argument, prints out the current score (e.g., "Old Dominion 38, 
               East Carolina 52), sleeps for the specified seconds, and then
               repeats (until control-C is hit).
               
            #Contains program to demonstrate "curl" well enough to
             correctly POST data to a form.  Show that the HTML response that
             is returned is "correct" (e.g., save it to a file and then view
             that file in a browser and take a screen shot).
